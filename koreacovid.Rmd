### Data is from the Patient_Info dataset from South Korea 1 Jan to 1 May 2020
### This data was retrieved from a downloadable zip file from kaggle

Some of the data was uncoded for sex - sex must be just male or female
77 of the data entries were coded sex  as blank, so we omit these.
state of a patient must be died or alive - we adjust that as well   
  
# Your Question - Is dying independent of sex?
